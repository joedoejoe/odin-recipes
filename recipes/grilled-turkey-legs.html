		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Grilled Turkey Legs</p>
		<p>
			These spicy turkey legs are sweet and hot--just like the smoked turkey
			legs you get at the fair or theme park!
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (2 liter) bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
			<li>4 turkey legs</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
			<li>
				In a large pot, mix the lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage, sugar,
				hot sauce, red pepper, pepper, and onion. Place the turkey legs in the
				mixture, and bring to a boil. Cook 30 to 45 minutes, until the turkey
				has reached an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove onion slices from the mixture, and arrange on the prepared grill.
				Place turkey legs over the onions. Drizzle with honey, and season with
